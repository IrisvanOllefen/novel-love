# Novel Love

Find Love by talking about what you love: Books!

## Job Story

When I have a new favorite book or am currently reading a different book, I want to change that on my profile, so I can find people with the same interests.

## How Does It Work

People who are interested in dating and having meaningful conversations, can use Novel Love. They can enter their top 3 favorite books of all time, and the bok they are currently reading. Then, they can find matches with an interest in the same books or genre. They can start meaningful and in-depth conversations about these books, so a start to the conversation is already made. This makes breaking the ice easier and people more approachable.
